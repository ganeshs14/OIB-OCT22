          <p class="fs-4">Eiichiro Oda, born January 1, 1975 in Kumamoto City, Kumamoto Prefecture in Japan, is a professional mangaka, best known as the creator of the manga One Piece.

            A dedicated writer and artist since adolescence, Oda began working for Shueisha's Shonen Jump at 17 and currently stands as one of the world's most prominent mangaka, earning an estimated ¥3.1 billion (US$26 million) per year.[2] Despite
            his
            rigorous work schedule, he maintains steady correspondence with fans (and the wider public) through both formal interviews and informal channels such as his SBS columns.

            Eiichiro Oda has been married to the former model, actress, "Campaign Girl", "Race Queen" and "Gravure Idol" Chiaki Inaba (稲葉ちあき, Inaba Chiaki) since November 7, 2004; and together have had two daughters; the first of whom was born in
            2006
            and the second in 2009.</p>
